# instructions
This Example is intended to explain some more testing tricks. You should read previous examples if you haven't.

## Codes explained
There are several techniques used in this examples:

1. Group Testing

To make your testing more structured, I used a more structured way. I grouped the testing cases into some data structure, and traverse the whole data structure to test all cases. Please refer to `test_group()` function to see more details.

2. Simple macro

Although I do not like macros, we could use it in moderation. So in this example I used one simple macro `#define EXEC` to make the code looks better. Again, it is your freedom to use it or not.

## Suggestions
You could add some more cases to observe what will happen.
