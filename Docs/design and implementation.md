# Design and Implementation
This document provides the design overview and implementation details of CAT project.

## Design Overview
- All codes in only header file, easy use.
- 

## Implementation Discussions
We use the following c++ features to build it:
- following c++ 11 standard. I think it should cover most university requirements.
- using c++ templates not too heavily. I know some guys hate c++ templates because the error messages output by compiler are disgusting. So we use it in moderation.
- We use namespace to avoid name confliction.
- We used some non standard colorful characters on the terminal. I think colorful output is a good idea to enhance readability.

The following techniques are NOT used or restricted:
- make, cmake or any building tools. I do not want to spend time learning other tools. Afterall, it is for real beginners.
- c++ macros. I am exhausted in macros. I hate that.

Some techniques that need to be discussed:
- Some testing frameworks use registration mechanisim. I do not think it is needed for simple tasks.
