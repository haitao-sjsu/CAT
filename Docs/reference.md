## Some other testing frameworks
There are some popular c++ framework for references. The information is provided by Gemini. By the way, I have no experience about them.

- Catch2: is a modern, single-header library known for its ease of use and expressive syntax. It's a great choice for students due to its simplicity and clear documentation.

- Doctest: is another beginner-friendly option with a similar single-header design and focus on readability. It's known for its fast compilation times, making it ideal for rapid feedback cycles.

- Google Test (gtest): is a widely used framework from Google. It offers a rich set of features including support for various test types (unit, death tests, etc.), advanced assertions, and easy test discovery. While powerful, it might have a slightly steeper learning curve for beginners.

- Boost.Test: is a mature framework part of the Boost C++ Libraries. It provides extensive functionality including test fixtures, test registration macros, and support for different test runners. It offers a good balance of features and complexity.
